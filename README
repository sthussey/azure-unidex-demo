# azure-unidex-demo

This is just some code to demonstrate how to build
a REST api in .Net Core and deploy it as an Azure App
Service using Terraform and Github Actions.

Over time I hope to expand on this to include more
enterprise concepts such as federated authentication,
CDN, analytics and logging, ...

I'll be writing some articles as this develops at
https://sthussey.github.io.
